# Linux Sys Admin

This repository contains material
for a course on Linux systems administration.
The content is written in markdown (see **src/** directory),
and is built using [mdBook][mdbook].

The book is complete (as of August 13, 2022)
and is hosted on my [website][linuxBook].
I consider this book a live document that will
be updated throughout the year
(probably more frequently before and
during the fall semesters when I teach this course).
There's still more I can cover, and
I will work to make the content clearer or less confusing
as I learn from my students what needs to be addressed.

The **archive/** directory contains
prior content that I want to save separately.
