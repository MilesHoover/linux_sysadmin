# Networking and Security

Even if we do not work as network administrators,
system administrators need to know network basics.
In this section, we cover TCP/IP and other protocols
related to the internet protocol suite,
and how to protect our systems locally,
from external threats,
and how to create backups of our systems in case
of disaster.
