This short book is based on a series of lectures
and demonstrations
for my course on Linux Systems Administration.

This is a very rough draft.
Until recently, we used VirtualBox and the Fedora distribution.
But I am in the process of converting content here
to demonstrate Google Cloud (gcloud)
and the Ubuntu distribution.

The work should be fairly complete by
start of the Fall 2022 semester.
