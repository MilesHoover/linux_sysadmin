# Learning the Command Line

It's obviously more common for people today
to learn how to use a computer via a 
graphical user interface, but
graphical user interfaces entail extra software, and
the more software we have on a server,
the more resources that software consumes, and
the more we expose our systems to security risks.

Graphical user interfaces also do not provide
a good platform for automation,
at least not remotely as well 
as command line interfaces do.
Working on the command line,
in what is know as a [shell][shell],
is in fact programming the computer.

Fortunately, Linux, and
many other Unix-like operating systems,
have the ability to operate without graphical user interfaces.
This is partly the reason why these operating systems
have done so well in the server market.

In this section,
our focus is learning the command line environment,
how to use it, and
what it offers.
