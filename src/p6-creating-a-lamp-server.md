# Creating a LAMP Server

In this section,
we learn how to set up a LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) stack.
This stack enables us to create a web server
that provides extra funtionality via PHP and MariaDB.
Even if we do not become web server administrators,
knowing how to set up a LAMP stack is not only fun, but
it's also a valuable skill to have.
