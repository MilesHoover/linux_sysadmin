More coverage of ``s-nail``:

Remember, if you want to alias the word ``mail`` to ``s-nail``, open ``nano``
and add this exactly to your **.bashrc** file:

```
alias mail='s-nail'
```

Then, exit ``nano``, and source the **.bashrc** file at the command prompt so
that it takes immediate effect. Like so:

```
source .bashrc
```

Once you've done that, you may type ``mail`` instead of ``s-nail``.
