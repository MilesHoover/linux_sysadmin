Pick ten Linux commands that we have covered in class, and:

- explain the purpose of the command based on what is stated in the
  documentation (that is, using either ``info [command]`` or ``man
  [command]`` and state which source you used (``info`` or ``man``)),
- provide one example use case of the command **without** a command line
  option and describe the output, and
- provide one example use case of the command **with** a command line
  option and describe the output.

The assignment must be written on *sised.is.uky.edu* in the ``nano`` text
editor and then emailed to me from your email accounts on the server. To email
me on *sised*, type (replace [your full name] with your full name in the
subject string and replace 'last-name' with your last name in the homework file
name):

```
s-nail -s "Homework 1, [your full name]" sean < homework-2-last-name.txt
```

Note: Some commands are Bash builtins and do not have either a ``man``
page or an ``info`` page. For example, ``cd`` is a Bash builtin. Your
homework assignment should **not** cover such commands.

Extra Credit: Plus 5pts if you write your homework assignment in *Markdown*.
Markdown must include at least *header* markup, in-line *code* markup, and
