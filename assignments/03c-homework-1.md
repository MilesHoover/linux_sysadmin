Locate an up-to-date website dedicated to Linux and that covers Systems
Administration. The site must be trade focused and updated frequently. Avoid
social media related sites for now (like Reddit, etc.).

Once you've located a site, look through the available articles. Pick one that interests you. Write a short description of the article and state why it might be relevant to Systems Administration. Include a sentence or two about the publisher and author of the site and include a link to the article. Be detailed in your description (cold, hard facts).

Aim for about 150-200 words.
